But the learning can’t stop there. As technology evolves, you must adapt. Through access to additional instructor-led trainings and free access to thousands of hours of content via Udemy, Pluralsight and other online platforms, you’ll never stop growing your skillset.
Communication/Leadership
While much of your time will be spent coding or on other highly technical work, this is a highly collaborative environment that will also make use of your communication and influencing skills. Whether you’re working with a project manager to set a realistic deadline, helping demo a product to a business partner, or working with internal stakeholders like Architecture or Security, we need engineers who can clearly communicate technical concepts, be great teammates, and influence without authority. You’ll be entrusted with meaningful work that impacts our customers, and you’ll be empowered to suggest new ideas.
The Most Important Thing
We believe bright people can learn new things, so while the qualifications below are important, there is one that we absolutely will not compromise on: attitude.

WHO YOU'LL WORK WITH
You’ll work with McKinsey’s agricultural analytics team (ACRE) in Denver, CO. ACRE is an agile team within the firm whose goal is to use the latest analytical methods, incubate new technologies and drive innovative ways to develop new opportunities for the firm to make significant and lasting client impact – redefining what it means to provide the best of the firm to our clients.
Our Agriculture Practice advises agribusiness, consumer food, government, and investor clients on strategic, marketing & sales, and operations issues, helping support industry-shaping decisions that impact the future of global food production.
Within this group, ACRE is a team of ~45 expert consultants, data scientists, and engineers focused on bringing cutting-edge analytics to our agribusiness clients. We apply real-time data and advanced analytics – generally predictive or geospatial in nature – to solve the biggest problems currently facing global agricultural markets, driving insights at the micro and macro levels.
WHAT YOU'LL DO
You will leverage industry knowledge and analytical expertise to provide insights both to clients as part of client service teams and within the ACRE team by strengthening the core products and algorithms we build for clients.
In this role you will split your time delivering impact at clients (either remotely or on site, when in-person travel resumes) and building up ACRE’s core analytical offerings in our Denver office (once in-person office attendance resumes).
As a member of client service teams, you will leverage your creativity and problem-solving skills to tackle clients’ most pressing issues using an analytical lens, meeting client needs and communicating your work to executive audiences. Issues to solve could include determining the suitability (now and in the future given impacts of climate change) of growing different types of crops across different geographies, using local agronomic data and satellite imagery to determine market potential for input products, or optimizing farm operations using yield forecasting. Your work will almost always include heavy geospatial components, although may also have predictive analytics components.
When working internally with the ACRE team, you will build innovative algorithms and products (what we call “IP development”) to best meet our most common client needs. You will use global data such as geospatial, biological, economic and climatological data to develop proprietary solutions. You will work with our engineers to design new interfaces to deliver faster, more impactful insights to our clients.
Along the way, you will receive best-in-class training in structuring business problems and serving as a client adviser and have opportunities to work closely with and learn from our senior agriculture practitioners and industry players that are shaping the future of food production. You will get access to unparalleled career acceleration, with a huge amount of ownership and responsibility from the get-go in a collaborative, diverse, non-hierarchical environment. You will get the opportunity to travel to client sites, locally and around the world (once travel resumes). Lastly, you will be able to provide direct and measurable impact to some of the largest agribusiness players around the globe.
We encourage you to submit a cover letter to highlight why you believe that you are a unique fit for our team and what we do!"

A global transition to a plant-based food system will turn back the clock on atmospheric CO2 levels, restore natural ecosystems and reverse meltdown in wildlife biomass.
The easiest - if not only - way to make our civilization sustainable is to eliminate livestock, the most dangerous technology on Earth. But humans won’t give up meat. So we need to make meat better - more delicious and more nutritious, without animals as the underlying production technology. That means that making meat sustainably is the most important and urgent problem for the global scientific community.
Impossible Foods' mission is to completely replace the use of animals as a food-production technology by offering consumers everything they currently value about animal products - and making products that are vastly superior to their animal analogues.
To do this, we are taking a revolutionary scientific and market-based approach. We are inventing efficient, sustainable ways to transform ingredients from plants into meat, fish and dairy foods that deliver all the pleasures and nutritional benefits consumers demand, without the destructive environmental or public health impact.
Our world-class R&D team has been building the know-how and technology platform to produce meat, fish and dairy foods from plants. Impossible Foods is experiencing rapid growth and is resolutely committed to leading all aspects of the plant-based food revolution—from discovery to commercial production.

A position for an Epidemiological Data Scientist is open at the Brotman Baty Institute (BBI), University of Washington, to work under the general guidance of Dr. Lea Starita, Co-Director of the BBI’s Advanced Technology Laboratory (BATlab), and Dr. Cecile Viboud at the Fogarty International Center, National Institute of Health. We are seeking a motivated person to work on the epidemiology of respiratory viruses in the greater Seattle area and model data from the Seattle Flu Study (SFS), an innovative multi-year surveillance project initiated in the fall of 2018, later expanded to include the Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network (SCAN). The initial study was launched to transform how infectious disease outbreaks are detected, monitored and controlled, including influenza epidemics and pandemics of respiratory viruses. Through this study, the population of the greater Seattle area has been heavily sampled for acute respiratory infections through enhanced hospital and community-based surveillance, novel direct-to-public recruitment programs, rapid diagnostic tests, 28-pathogen open-array testing, and full genomic sequencing. More than 50,000 specimens have been collected to date and have shed light on the dynamics of influenza, SARS-CoV2, RSV, and rhinoviruses, and other common viruses.


The data scientist will study the epidemiology of respiratory pathogens under different conditions of population contacts and behavior, contrasting patterns observed during the COVID19 pandemic and earlier seasons. In particular, the data scientist will analyze data from a large demographic, geographic and behavioral survey of individuals who are tested for respiratory viruses in the community (SCAN). The data scientist will use these data to identify specific exposures and settings (household, school, travel) that drive transmission, and explore how transmission risk factors vary between pathogens, geography, age and ethnicity. The data scientist will use a variety of epidemiological approaches to study these questions, including test-negative case-control design, regression analyses, and time series models.


In addition to working with Drs. Starita and Viboud, the data scientist will work in close collaboration with Dr. Trevor Bedford, of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC), and a large team of researchers involved in the Seattle Flu Study and Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network.

Description of Work Unit
The Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere (CIRA) at Colorado State University (CSU) is a multi-million dollar research organization located on CSU’s Foothills Campus in Fort Collins, Colorado. CIRA is a cooperative institute (CI) that is also a research department within CSU’s College of Engineering, in partnership with the Department of Atmospheric Science. Its vision is to conduct interdisciplinary research in the atmospheric sciences by entraining skills beyond the meteorological disciplines, exploiting advances in engineering and computer science, facilitating transitional activity between pure and applied research, leveraging both national and international resources and partnerships, and assisting the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), CSU, the State of Colorado, and the Nation through the application of our research to areas of societal benefit. Expanding on this Vision, our Mission is to serve as a nexus for multi-disciplinary cooperation among CI and NOAA research scientists, University faculty, staff and students in the context of NOAA-specified research theme areas in satellite applications for weather/climate forecasting. Important bridging elements of the CI include the communication of research findings to the international scientific community, transition of applications and capabilities to NOAA operational users, education and training programs for operational user proficiency, outreach programs to K-12 education and the general public for environmental literacy, and understanding and quantifying the societal impacts of NOAA research.
