Walmart is the largest retail corporation in the world and the Merchant Tech Data Science team is disrupting and revolutionizing the establishment by being more data driven in their analysis and integrating Machine Learning algorithms to get a more comprehensive understanding of details missed by humans. We extend our reach to 4000 stores across US for testing and deploying sophisticated models of all kinds for every facet or step during the retail supply chain lifecycle. The sophistication afforded by machine learning algorithms allows for more segmentation, which allows for more detailed and descriptive insights. In attempting this, we are also reshaping the attitude of the business towards adopting and trusting AI to be most impactful based on the amount of historical data and investment required.

There is a wide gamut of challenges and the obstacles are numerous to shift the thinking between solving for customers’ needs in physical stores versus e-commerce. The challenge of employing ML techniques in retail at such a wide scale, across varied categories of items, presents a great opportunity for creative solutions. The Merch Tech Data Science team tackles this task and it’s problems at multiple fronts.

Machine learning algorithms can tell a more complete story to identify anomalies and pinpoint each step of the process along the supply chain. Human bias and guesswork is eliminated, and this is applicable for any stage, be it warehouse processing or vendor management. We work on building stable automated pipelines to take care of these issues.

The goals of this team are to generate tangible insights from data collected across multiple channels and to use algorithms and models that can process and learn from these huge datasets to make actionable predictions and recommendations.

About Clara Foods™

Clara Foods™ is a Bay Area venture capital-backed company working towards a disruptive advance in food technology by producing animal proteins without the animal using fermentation. We join a new generation of entrepreneurs, activists, and scientists who recognize that the decades-old factory farm model cannot sustain the dietary needs of 7 billion people and counting - and that technology may hold a solution.




As much as the growing market demands for animal protein production exert pressure on food producers to improve their efficiencies and outputs, there is also growing public distaste for the environmental, animal welfare, and health compromises of industrial-scale animal agriculture.




Clara Foods™ aims to subvert this moral and economic deadlock by taking the animal out of the equation. We’re bringing products to the table that are produced completely animal-free, use less land and water inputs, while matching the taste, nutritional value, and unique culinary properties of animal proteins.

Company

LendingTree is the nation's largest online lending marketplace. That means we connect customers with multiple lenders so they find the best deals on loans, credit cards, savings accounts and insurance. Our goal is to help people save money, and we believe the best way to do that is by giving them a way to shop for loans and compare lenders so they make their best financial choices.

Our CEO Doug Lebda founded the company in 1996 after a frustrating house-hunting experience. In those days, we mostly helped people find good mortgage deals. Now, we help consumers find their best in personal loans, auto loans, business loans, student loans, credit cards, savings accounts, home equity loans and more.

What else you should know:

We're a publicly-traded company (TREE).
We've welcomed several other companies into the LendingTree family to augment our efforts at helping borrowers make their most sensible financial choices.
We've built the LendingTree app and My LendingTree dashboard to give consumers tools to manage and monitor their financial health.
We still make funny commercials.

A Little Bit About Us…

The medical apparel industry is antiquated, highly fragmented and, until FIGS, was driven solely by low-cost providers offering a limited selection of poor quality products sold through third party distributors. FIGS is revolutionizing the medical apparel industry by creating the highest quality medical apparel in the world and by selling directly to medical professionals through our branded ecommerce site.

FIGS’ foundation is built on product quality, and we have a relentless focus on three key areas: fabric, fit and function. We developed our proprietary, performance-oriented fabric technology to meet the demands of the medical profession. FIGS’ Technical Collection fabric is wrinkle resistant, moisture-wicking, lightweight, breathable and offers four-way stretch. Our designs are tailored, sophisticated and innovative, incorporating features such as yoga waistbands, smart storage (pockets, zippers, hidden pockets) and inspirational sayings inside each garment that appeal to modern healthcare professionals.

By offering a branded and customer-centric online shopping experience, we are changing how medical professionals buy their workwear. Through our website, social media, and participation in medical conferences and events, we have built a strong following within the medical community and a meaningful connection with our customers, which allows us to understand their needs and to ensure that FIGS is continuously improving and innovating.

FIGS’ Threads for Threads initiative is central to our mission. FIGS has donated hundreds of thousands of scrubs to healthcare providers in need around the world.

Who We Are.

Root Insurance is the nation’s first licensed insurance carrier powered entirely by mobile. We were founded on the belief that the services you need for everyday life should serve you better.

We recognize that our product is only as good as the people building and promoting it. We look for individuals who find solutions by going through the cycle of ideation to implementation with curiosity, rigor, and a highly analytical lens. Ask anyone who works here and you’ll hear similar reasons for why they joined:

Autonomy. For assertive self-starters, the opportunities to contribute are limitless.

What we are doing now:

We are a profitable and stable artificial intelligence startup that is building a tool that automatically writes content about any subject with the same level of quality, factual accuracy, and usefulness as a human.




What we are building towards:

Our dream is two parts:

Part one: Develop strong AI – artificial intelligence that is smarter than a human.

Part two: Do this without selling our souls to venture capitalists or outside investors who will be more focused on Q4 profit, than on making sure this technology creates a profoundly better society.




How we plan on getting towards that goal:

Cortx is entirely self-funded and is already profitable by selling awesome artificial intelligence products. We want to continue to advance artificial intelligence through sustainable, iterative, and self-funded improvements so that we can eventually reach our end goal while remaining independent and principled.




We have a product roadmap where we create and deliver products that our users love, with the requirement that everything we work on is furthering our research and understanding of complicated artificial intelligence concepts.




What you will be doing:

We currently sell a product that generates content based on user input using large transformer networks. Our customers love the product, the content looks and reads well, but still is lacking in factual accuracy and relevance.




You will be working directly with the Founder & CEO (who is leading the artificial intelligence team, both as a manager and as an individual contributor) and other developers to bridge this gap and build a product that is able to generate high quality, factually relevant and interesting content about any keyword that a user inputs.




This will involve training new models and making improvements to existing ones. You will constantly be ingesting research papers, finding and implementing ways to take what is cutting edge, and writing production code to apply it to our goals. You will be analyzing where our current methods are falling short and devising and implementing ways to improve and iterate.




What you’ll mainly be working in:

PyTorch (Hugging Face Transformers)




What we want from you:

You read this job posting and mission statement and found it to be inspiring
Your dream job is in the field of artificial intelligence
You are an awesome developer with a Computer Science (or very similar) background
You have experience (professionally, through internships, or through personal projects) with using transformers to solve natural language generation or information retrieval problems
A solid enough understanding of math that you can read and understand AI research papers
Experience writing production code
You take immense pride in the work you do and think you are exceptional
You want to be contributing ideas, values, thoughts, and direction (we are a small company, and your boss is the Founder/CEO, so we want people who want to make a mark on our direction and vision!)




Some benefits of working at Cortx include:

Generous salary – we would rather have one superstar than two mediocre players
Equity - Ownership in what you are creating at a fast growing startup
Premium benefits – Completely paid health coverage, 401k, profit sharing, gym membership, and more
Offices located on the water in Baltimore’s Inner Harbor
Freedom of working at a small company – you will report directly to the CEO
The excitement of a startup with the stability of a profitable company
We work on interesting problems that push the envelope in AI

As a result, there are hundreds of moving pieces and no shortage of fascinating challenges across all levels of the stack.

Above all, Aquabyte is a customer-driven company. Our product development is dictated by the needs of fish farmers and we prioritize customer delight in everything we do. We are committed to build a global, collaborative team that creates value far beyond Silicon Valley.

The role

Our product is entirely dependent on sophisticated machine learning, deep learning, and sophisticated software architectures to create value for fish farmers. As a Machine Learning Engineer, you will use machine learning to extract valuable information from visual features surfaced by deep learning models, and analyze incoming time-series data so that fish farmers make better strategic and operational decisions.

In 2019, global battery production could power ~5 million EVs, however the equivalent of ~1 in every 6 batteries were scrapped in production. That’s ~$4 Billion of waste in 2019, due largely to insufficient data and analytics in production. Batteries are fundamental to our clean energy transition, but unless we change the status quo, their cost will remain a major barrier.

About Feasible, Inc.

Our mission is to accelerate the clean energy transition by decreasing the cost of battery manufacturing. We are pioneers in advanced process inspection & intelligence solutions, enabling our customers to “See Batteries Differently.” Our EchoStat platform uses ultrasound and data analytics to deliver unique, valuable insights that create value in battery production by speeding up time-to-market for new batteries, accelerating yield ramp for new production processes, and improving steady-state productivity.

Founded in 2016, Feasible is headquartered in Emeryville, CA. Since inception, Feasible has received over $9M in grants and equity funding from Chrysalix Ventures, Incite Labs, NSF, DOE (ARPA-e), California Energy Commission, Elemental Excelerator, Activate (formerly Cyclotron Road), and others. We have active validation programs with leading battery manufacturers and automakers, and are deploying our first commercial systems this year.

Our Culture and Values

We are dedicated to building a world-class company that will improve the world.
We work closely on a foundation of mutual trust and data-driven decisions.
We value personal growth, continuous learning, safety, and inclusion.
We believe the most innovative teams seek out, welcome and celebrate all forms of diversity.



Role

As a data scientist at Feasible you will join a small, nimble team of engineers creating cutting-edge battery inspection equipment. You will be an integral part of analyzing the data produced with this equipment, developing a deeper understanding of the data's relationship to the battery's production history and performance, and creating tools and techniques to achieve those goals.

On a typical day, you may perform investigative analysis on experimental data; design and implement algorithms for distilling ultrasonic signals into meaningful features, and correlate those features with performance data; build analytics tools and visualizations to empower our engineers and customers; optimize, automate, and streamline our analytics pipeline, and integrate the pipeline with real-time data streams; or communicate your work to stakeholders with varied backgrounds.

You value careful listening, thoughtful questions, and data-driven discussions. You are comfortable with gathering and distilling information to drive the direction of open-ended projects.

The ideal candidate will approach this work with a mixture of intellectual curiosity, thoughtful creativity, and methodical rigor.

If you want to solve massive, real-world problems with the best technology and smartest people, come work with us!

Global trade is a fundamental human need for delivering products to the people who need them. In today's on-demand economy, customer expectations have risen to an all-time high and moreover, continue to evolve.

Unfortunately, supply chains can no longer keep up because freight is moved based on static plans and the data/technology is inadequate for companies to adjust on the fly, let alone provide the transparency that customers expect. As a result people don’t receive the goods they need in the manner they want to receive them.

We believe winning companies will treat the supply chain like the continuously evolving system it actually is. Companies will provide 1) Amazon-like delivery with 2) a digital customer experience. To do so, they must have an intelligent software platform built on a foundation of clean & accurate data. ClearMetal is uniquely able to offer an enterprise software platform to global shippers that enables a Continuous Delivery Experience by 1) improving freight delivery to meet rising customer expectations and 2) empowering a modern digital customer experience.

Create the model that transforms the mortgage industry

Want to infuse a $20B sector of the insurance and real estate industry with predictive analytics and a tech-forward customer experience? Yearning for a startup culture within a profitable nationwide company? Join States Title and send an entirely new type of real estate model into the wild.

Every mortgage or refinance transaction requires our product: title and escrow. Title insurance protects banks and homeowners against financially irresponsible actors or legal issues that cloud their rights; escrow makes sure the right people get paid at the end of the day.

In an uncertain real estate market, lenders, banks and realtors are dying to know how to boost their margins. They are switching their customers to States Title because our data science algorithms, streamlined deal closing technologies, and overall product experience is leaps and bounds above what they’re used to in terms of speed and value in title and escrow.

Our streamlined algorithms have revolutionized the title and escrow process and allowed us to scale rapidly: we closed our acquisition of North American Title Company in early 2019 to go from startup to #8 in the country. With a broader nationwide footprint and a huge data set for machine learning, we are poised to transform this industry. We will repurpose the billions wasted in rote, manual tasks to make homeownership easier and less risky, helping people invest time and money into more meaningful parts of their lives.

We're growing our document parsing data science team

We're looking for someone who is fired up to automate the manual labor currently associated with ingesting, reviewing, and reconciling the dozens of types of documents that need comprehension during a real estate transaction. This means everything from using advanced optical character recognition techniques to parse scanned documents, to using natural language processing to check their validity and action them.

As a data scientist at States Title, you'll take part in a fun and respectful corporate atmosphere. You'll interact frequently with an executive team that has significant accomplishments at Oracle, PayPal, McKinsey, and Capital One behind them. Much more than a model builder, you'll talk directly with VP+ customers and stakeholders, vet and negotiate deals with vendors, recommend strategies to change the direction of the company, and discuss data stewardship and model governance with deep legal minds in the public and private sectors.

We're proud of the sophisticated data ingestion process we have built, as well as the multi-model ecosystem that is already live, with its parts working together to orchestrate an instant insurance decision in a robust, well-managed, and well-tested way. We have high expectations of communication, accountability, and mathematical rigor, and are looking for those who would be inspired and stimulated in such an environment.

Do you have what it takes?


Relevant experience in data science

Excitement about delivering industry-shaking document parsing algorithms using natural language processing (NLP)
Experience in document processing is a plus, but not required: we will consider all accomplished persons in any area of NLP
Strengths aligned with our needs

E.g. Can you explain how convolutional kernels or attention mechanisms work without making reference to computers?
E.g. When you write a python library that tests the score distribution of incoming orders against expectation, does Engineering praise the quality of your code?
E.g. When out-of-the-box regression on a continuous target isn't good enough, can you come up with a customized loss function for the problem?
E.g. Can you get a group to make a controversial decision in fewer than 30 minutes?


We want to help you do the best work of your life

We believe the most valuable investment we can make — and the greatest boost we can give your career — is an exceptional team of colleagues who are passionate about what we are doing.

We currently offer the following benefits and will continually evolve them with the goal of efficiently attracting, retaining, and leveraging the very highest quality talent.


Our passionate, capable team will always be our #1 benefit
We are proud of the team we have built so far, and we are excited about the team we have yet to add
Learn something new every day
Get more done than you would anywhere else

ABOUT THE ROLE:


Our Data Scientists are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in most aspects of designing, researching, building, and delivering data-focused products for our clients.
Our Data Science team is embedded into nearly a dozen individual, mission-focused engineering teams working across a wide spectrum of technological and scientific challenges. You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and background, to work on problems related to natural language processing and machine learning over hundreds of millions of web pages, graph mining and algorithmic optimization on petabytes of data, and causal inference with missing data - to name a few.
Data Scientists contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. We are a team built on a foundation of generosity and openness, and we expect our data scientists to help make others better and raise the bar for those around them.

WHO WE ARE LOOKING FOR:


You have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large and impactful machine learning projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you are doing.
You have a strong sense of data intuition. At our scale, many off-the-shelf modeling techniques (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles and intuition to develop solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.
You are a broadly skilled data scientist who may have experience working with embedded models in always-on production systems and may have worked across a variety of technologies and data sources.
You have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world’s largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making.
You work with confidence and without ego. Our data scientists have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates.
You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.
You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.

Make a big contribution across our entire product in this small, passionate team


At Shelf Engine, we’re harnessing the power of AI to provide real-time, intelligent forecasting for food retailers like grocery stores, food service, and cafes across the United States. We’re able to drastically reduce the amount of shrink (food waste) which in turn drives profit for retailers, lowers costs for consumers, and reduces the ecological impact of waste. We’re using technology to solve a globally-relevant problem that both creates a positive environmental impact and an exciting (and potentially massive) commercial opportunity.

We are hiring a Data Scientist to join our growing Engineering and Data team. You will be spearheading projects across the organization to determine what data we collect and how, and which other sources we passively utilize to improve our day to day business processes. Your background in mathematics, statistics, and business logic will directly impact the accuracy of our forecasting, striking a fine balance between reducing customers food waste, and avoiding understocking situations. Help us solve critical problems related to the following areas: time-series analysis, demand forecasting, predictive modeling and machine learning, feature identification & pattern recognition, model segmentation & aggregation, constrained optimization.

As a Data Scientist At Shelf Engine, You Will

Work cross-functionally (e.g. Product, Engineering, Operations, etc) to frame problems, both mathematically and within the business context; to measure and optimize products and business processes; to identify opportunities, assess risk potentials and explain trends; to drive customer adoption and revenue growth
Own the end-to-end experience with data, including querying, aggregation, deep analysis, visualization and models; presenting findings/actionable insights to internal and external stakeholders
Design, analyze, and run both simulated and live experiments (A/B and multivariate tests) to drive KPI improvement
Continuously improve the quality and accessibility of our analytical capabilities and framework as well as data reporting infrastructure
Assist in data requirements gathering and data validations to improve data platforms

And we think you would make a great Data Scientist if you:

Have a Masters degree in a related quantitative field (Computer Science, Math, Statistics, Engineering, Physics, Economics)
Bring 4+ years of relevant working experience in a similar role, preferably with specific experience in the domain of time series demand or other forecasting
Have production-level experience with data querying languages (e.g. SQL), scripting languages (e.g. Python), and statistical/mathematical programming languages (e.g. R, Matlab)
Expertise with statistical analysis, applying various machine learning techniques, especially predictive modeling, to solve business problems
Bring a proven ability to think creatively, solve problems, learn quickly, work independently, handle ambiguity, and adapt to change in a fast-paced environment
Excellent written, verbal, and interpersonal communication and presentation skills


About Us

At Shelf Engine, you will join an inclusive team of driven, passionate, and caring people hungry for change in an untapped industry. Our founders are well versed in the food industry and have successfully built product and engineering teams.

About Dexterity

At Dexterity we’re building robotic automation systems to perform complex semi-structured pick-place-pack tasks in warehouses. Our end-to-end automation systems use intelligent software to enable human-like dexterity in commodity robot arms. Such intelligent robots will deeply impact the logistics industry and help realize a step change in logistics automation and supply chain productivity.

Dexterity is one of the fastest growing and best funded startups in the robot manipulation space. Come join our team of robot-obsessed engineers and help make intelligent robots a reality.

About The Role

In this role at Dexterity, you will be working on building Machine Learning models to support our computer vision and data analysis efforts. The role will involve understanding our current systems and their limitations and bringing your expertise in augmenting and developing ML models.

We are very interested in expertise around the subfields of semantic segmentation and instance segmentation and your role will involve keeping up to date with the latest papers in these areas and implementing them using platforms like Tensorflow, Pytorch, etc... Robotics data also comes in a variety of different forms (time series, alerts, etc..) that are targets for models to help us predict and analyze behaviors emerging from our robotics systems. Your job will not only be finding and perfecting the right model(s) and architecture, but also identifying key problems throughout our system that can be solved with machine learning.

Experience with RGBD datasets and point clouds is also very important to the type of problems you will encounter in this role and experience in the areas of ML for autonomous vehicles or robotics is very useful. In addition to all of this, a solid grounding in writing optimized code in c++ and python and understanding limitations of languages and frameworks is critical. Additionally familiarity with cloud infrastructure to build training and serving pipelines is also a key aspect to this role.

At Dexterity, our use cases require low latency inference that approaches real time and therefore you must be able to build highly performant models and serving architectures. While an understanding of open source solutions is a useful prerequisite, we also require that the candidate has experience building their own models, training pipelines and serving infrastructure to run a production system. The end to end process of gathering data, augmenting data, studying performance and optimizing quality of the model, and deploying and troubleshooting models on the field will be under your purview.

Familiarity With The The Following Papers Is a Bonus

https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12872

https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870

5 or more years of related work experience.

Strong knowledge of Modern C++ and Python.

Experience creating Tensorflow and Pytorch graphs.

Experience using profilers and debuggers to optimize code.

Experience building and maintaining production code.

Prior experience building and training production ML models from scratch using Tensorflow and pytorch.

Experience with serving architectures like NVIDIA Triton and Tensorflow Serving, flask and others.

Strong academic background and knowledge of ML and academic papers.

Experience with cloud infrastructure such as AWS, GCP, Azure etc. and experience using this infrastructure to create training and serving pipelines.

Ability to trace and solve problems across interconnected systems, pipelines and applications.

Self starter with build and installation systems (CMake, setuptools, etc…).

Knowledge of containerization and paradigms (docker, kubernetes, etc...).

Strong experience with software development processes (testing, CI/CD, design documentation, project management workflow, code reviews, source control conventions).

Experience deploying softwares and configuring distributed systems.

Equal Opportunity Employer

We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

We innovate in the field of clinical genomics, digital pathology, and pathology informatics.

We are looking for someone with the ability to navigate complex data from diverse sources.

One interesting aspect of our work is that many cutting-edge technologies do not pass the stringent quality requirements of clinical care and cannot be implemented. These decisions are very hard and always a balancing act. On the one side we have a rigorous regulatory framework that governs highest quality of patient care. On the other hand, we need to tinker with technologies and data to unlock their full potential for patient care. We have chosen an interdisciplinary approach and pressure test all new technologies in their various settings and applications. However, one of the biggest challenges is effectively navigating the data flow between real world machines and the relevant computational systems. Would you like to help?
